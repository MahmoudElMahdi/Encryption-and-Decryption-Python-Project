Transposition Cipher algorithm that can encrypt and decrypt a message using the transposition cipher—a simple yet effective way of encrypting a text in a way that becomes unreadable to anyone who doesn’t possess the key to decryption. It relies on scrambling the words in plaintext by rearranging its characters according to a specific algorithm.
